# Pitch
// Todo
- Answer a basic question, “How can we use the type system to make building strong apps easy(er?)”
- Stronger as in "won't compile if you're doing it wrong" “with less errors”
- Easy as in “The type system should help me follow the business rules and show me the possible errors/edge cases”
- to not only prevent basic errors, but also to get feedback from the compiler when we're trying to do something unexpected by the app

on va aider batstagram a depiler ses issues, et pour chaque issue,
voir comment on peut repenser les types pour empecher l'erreur de se reproduire (aka compile pas)

## Hello ðŸ‘‹

<Notes>
Sooo there's a new startup in town, it's called Batstagram.

<Notes>
It's like instagram but for picture of bats.
It' been growing like crazy, the userbase has grown exponentially each week in the past 3 months and I'm happy to report that they now officially have more than 10 users!

I think this deserves a round of applause

 Good market reseach pays off!

<Steps>

- Friends
- Trending bats report
- Obviously AI driven content suggestion
- Ai driven bat species categorization
- Ai driven bat picture search
- An ad platform,
- A dark theme
- ...

</Steps>

<Notes>
The app has all the feature you would expect for such an app: (show each bullet point one after the other)

You get it

But on the development side, not so much

It's been a bit frustrating for them lately

<Notes>
It feels like each time they fix a bug, there's another one popping up (marteau lapin)

And that sucks even more because that's exactly why they chose to use a typed language
to avoid that

Because it's written on the box, if it compiles, it works

(gif party or some ultra stock photo handshake)

<Notes>
So, we met with the CTO and he'd like us to help.

So I thought maybe we could could unpile some of their opened issues and come up with some rules on

{/* - Answer a basic question, “How can we use the type system to make building strong apps easy(er?)” */}

to not only prevent basic errors, but also to get feedback from the compiler
 when we're trying to do something unexpected by the app or contrary to the business rules

(aka don't compile if it won't/shouldn't work)

{/* make sure every edge case is handledget help from the compile make sure */}
{/* in such a way that if an edge case isn't handled correctly or something doesn't match the requirements, */}
{/* the app just won't compile */}
</Notes>

Aka thinking types first

  This one sucks, it's on the store so we're lossing money and preventing people from buying our amazing swag
  Page blanch sur la page produit sans tag

  Notre tech lead est déjà sur le coup et à identifié une cause probable:
  Quand tag undefined
  On fait un appel non conforme à ce que le backend attend

<CodeSurfer>

```ts 4,7

const ProductsList = async (props: {}) => {

  const tag = useQueryParam("tag")!,
   [products, setProducts] = useState<Product[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    getAllProductsForTag(tag).then(setProducts)
  }, [tag])

  return <div>{/* View Stuff */}</div>
}

```

  - Explain the code
  - Explain why does this compile if it's broken
  - How can we rethink this to fail the build if the edge case isn't handled ?
    - Thought process using 5 whys ?
  - What's the jist/rule here
</Notes>

---

### Rule 1 - Keep it real

If there's a possibility it might be somehow maybe why not possibly undefined. It will happen!

// TODO: Add image

  Issue 2

  Product page is broken again

// Todo: hint image

  - Explain the code
    - The team has gained some confidence in using typescript since the last time
    - So they added more precise types to part of the app
  - Explain why does this compile if it's broken
  - How can we rethink this to fail the build if the edge case isn't handled ?
    - Thought process using 5 whys ?
  - What's the jist/rule here

## The meat

# Hello ðŸ‘‹
(intro story)
- automated tests are the shit
- but the more i write typescript
- the more i find i need them less
- More and more, i find less and less value in tests and more about thinking in types correctly
- Up to a point where i'm actually surprised if a code i wrote doesn't work while it compiled --> STORY

---
## What
- An i thought it would be intersting to decompose the thought process behind that and come up with some rules.
- So,let's answer this question: "How can we leverage the type system to force us to deal with edge cases and enforce business rules"
- Answer a basic question, “How can we use the type system to make building strong apps easy(er?)”
- Stronger as in “with less errors”
- Easy as in “The type system should help me follow the business rules and show me the possible errors/edge cases”
---

## Why should you care ?

---

## Agenda
- The meat: 7 rules
- Going further: Cool stuff to look for to go to the next level

---

## The meat

---

### Rule 1 - Keep it real

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts file=./snippets/issue-1.tsx
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

If it might be undefined don't pretend it's not
strategy: maybe

---

### Rule 2 - No but really, keep it real

---
<!-- /blah?filter=hakkedULolz or image: Displaying all products for "hakkedULolz" (la redoute)
<!-- - remember previous exam ple ? Well the users do, we have a bug -->
<!-- - The worse thing than something being untyped is something wrongly typed. -->
<!-- if it can be any freaking thing + what you expect, the real type is "any freaking thing" --> -->
<CodeSurfer>

```ts file=./snippets/issue-1.tsx
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

If it can be any freaking thing + what you expect, the real type is "any freaking thing"
strategy: largest type possible

---

### Rule 3 - Don't throw errors away.

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts file=./snippets/issue-1.tsx
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

If it's hidden, it won't get handled. If "errors" are an expected behavior of your function, document them
- Errors are part of the spec for a function. Don't throw them away and leave, be a nice guy, document them and then they'll be handled (total functions)
- Strategy: either

---

### Rule 4 - Make impossible states impossible

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts file=./snippets/issue-1.tsx
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

If something should not be possible, make sure it cannot happen
strategy: union types + state table

---

### Rule 5 - Beware the duck

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts file=./snippets/issue-1.tsx
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

miles vs kms
strategy: opaque types/branded types

---

### Rule 6 - Protect business rules/ensure validity, birth control
Make sure any created object matches your domain rules by controlling instanciation (factory/opaque types/smart constructor)

---

### Rule 7 - Require the most constrained thingy (SvcAccount > user)
strategy: Require the most constrained thingy/the smallest subset
---

### Rule 8 - Match the spec
- Find the business names in the spec and program by whishfull thinking

---

## Going further
express the maybe viewer loading state for namesavbar
---

## Goodbye
